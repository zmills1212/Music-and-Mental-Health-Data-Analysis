# Music and Mental Health: An Exploratory Data Analysis

This project investigates the correlation between music listening habits and various mental health indicators, using a dataset from Kaggle. 
The goal is to explore the role music plays in an individual's quality of life and overall mental well-being, specifically focusing on its impact on stress, anxiety, depression, and other related attributes.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is the "MXMH Survey Results" dataset available on Kaggle: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/catherinerasgaitis/mxmh-survey-results](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/catherinerasgaitis/mxmh-survey-results)

This dataset includes information on:

* Music genres listened to
* Levels of depression, anxiety, and OCD
* Age
* Hours of music listening per day
* And other relevant mental health attributes

## Research Questions

1. How much does music play a role in a person's quality of life and overall mental health?
2. How does the duration of music listening throughout the day affect one's mental health?  Does listening to more music improve or decrease different mental health indicators?
3. What is the relationship between hours of music listened to and mental health rankings (high vs. low)?
4. What is the age range of the participants in this study?

## Methodology

This analysis was conducted using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. The following steps were taken:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** 
3. **Data Visualization:** 
4. **Analysis and Interpretation:** 

## Key Findings

* The genres of music people listen to directly affect their mental health.  (Give a specific example, like "Listeners of rock music showed a tendency towards higher levels of mental health challenges compared to listeners of genres like Lofi.")
* Music with softer beats and positive messages (e.g., pop, Lofi) were associated with improved quality of life.
* A correlation was observed between higher music listening duration and insomnia.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a clear link between music and mental well-being. The type of music consumed significantly impacts an individual's mental state.  The findings suggest that music can be a powerful tool for influencing mood and overall quality of life.

## Future Work (Optional)

* The dataset could be enhanced with additional demographic information (e.g., sex, location, pre-existing mental health conditions) to provide a more comprehensive analysis.  This would allow for exploring the impact of music across different demographics and backgrounds.
* Further research could investigate the specific musical elements (e.g., tempo, melody, lyrics) that contribute to positive or negative mental health outcomes.
